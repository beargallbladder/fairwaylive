# FairwayLive - COMPLETE User Flow

## The Problem
The original app had:
- No context of WHO you're playing with (random names appeared)
- No feedback when recording audio 
- No explanation of what happens to your voice
- No clear betting flow
- Disconnected technical pieces instead of an experience

## The Solution: Complete User Journey

### 1. **Player Selection** (WHO)
- App starts by asking "Who's playing today?"
- Shows your golf buddies with names, handicaps, and personalities
- You SELECT who you're playing with
- Clear visual feedback on selection

### 2. **Round Setup** (CONTEXT)
- Shows all selected players in the round
- Displays current scores for each player
- Clear hole information (Par 4, 385 yards)
- Everyone starts at Even (E)

### 3. **Voice Betting** (WHAT)
When you hold the microphone button:
- **Immediate feedback**: "Recording..." indicator
- **After speaking**: Shows EXACTLY what you said
- **Bet parsing**: Shows what bet was understood
- **Confirmation**: Clear button to place or cancel bet

Example flow:
- You say: "I'll take birdie for 50"
- App shows: 
  - What you said: "I'll take birdie for 50"
  - Bet understood: $50 on birdie
  - Action buttons: [Place Bet] [Cancel]

### 4. **Odds Explanation** (WHY)
When confirming a bet, you see:
- Base odds (e.g., 3.5x for birdie)
- WHY those odds:
  - "Birdie is harder than par (+1.5x)"
  - "More players = more competition (+10%)"
- Potential payout clearly shown

### 5. **Live Activity** (SOCIAL)
- See other players' bets and reactions
- "Mike matched your bet"
- "Tom laughed at your bet"
- Creates social dynamics and trash talk

### 6. **Score Entry** (PROGRESS)
- Simple buttons to score each hole
- Automatically updates running totals
- Moves to next hole
- Clears bets for fresh start

## Complete Flow Example

1. **Start**: "Who's playing?" → Select Mike, Tom, Sarah
2. **Hole 1**: Par 4, everyone at Even
3. **You bet**: Hold mic → "50 on birdie" → Confirm → Bet placed
4. **Feedback**: "Bet placed! $50 to win $175"
5. **Social**: Mike reacts, Tom places counter-bet
6. **Score**: You score 3 (birdie!) → Win bet → +$175
7. **Next hole**: Fresh start, new bets

## Key Improvements

### Before (Broken)
- Click "START ROUND" → Nothing happens
- Record audio → No feedback
- Random people in bets → No context
- No idea what's happening

### After (Complete)
- Every action has feedback
- Clear player context
- Voice → Transcription → Bet → Confirmation
- Social reactions and live updates
- Complete betting lifecycle

## MCP Orchestration Pattern

Following ruvnet's approach:
- **Orchestrator** coordinates all services
- **Immediate feedback** at every step
- **Clear state transitions**
- **Social dynamics** built in
- **Complete user journey**, not fragments

The app now shows WHO you're playing with, WHAT happens when you speak, WHY odds change, and HOW the entire flow works - creating a complete Vegas-style golf betting experience.
